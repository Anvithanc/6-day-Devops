🌐 Introduction to DevOps
Combines Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) to improve collaboration.

Focuses on automation, continuous delivery, and faster deployment.

Core goals: Faster releases, reliable systems, and shorter development cycles.

⚙️ Key DevOps Principles
CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Automation of testing, building, and deployment

Monitoring & Feedback loops

Collaboration and Communication

🛠️ Essential Tools in DevOps
Version Control:
Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

CI/CD Tools:
Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI

Configuration Management:
Ansible, Chef, Puppet

Containerization:
Docker (Create, deploy, and run applications in containers)

Orchestration:
Kubernetes (Manage containerized applications at scale)

Infrastructure as Code:
Terraform, AWS CloudFormation

Cloud Platforms:
AWS, Azure, Google Cloud (GCP)
Core Cloud Concepts
EC2, S3, IAM, RDS, VPC

Auto-scaling and Load Balancing

Security (IAM roles, MFA, Policies)


🧱 Containers & Docker
Dockerfile, Images, Containers

Docker Compose

Building and pushing to Docker Hub

🚀 Kubernetes Basics
Pods, Nodes, Deployments, Services

Helm Charts

Scaling and rolling updates

🧾 CI/CD Pipeline Workflow
Code is pushed to a repository.

Automated tests are run.

Application is built and packaged (e.g., into Docker containers).

It’s deployed to testing/staging/production environments.

📦 Infrastructure Automation
Writing IaC using Terraform

Provisioning cloud infrastructure automatically

🔒 Security in DevOps
Secrets management

Role-based access control (RBAC)

Secure deployment practices

📊 Monitoring & Logging
Real-time performance tracking

Alerting & incident response

Log aggregation
